<blockquote id="quote1"> 
   <i> Is it a good thing? Is that a bad thing? I don't know. </i> 
   - May 11, 2016, <b> Alexandre Gorius</b>
    <br> <br> <strong> In nature, Good & Evil do not exist. Universe itself is neither good nor bad, but a potential in permanent development. </strong> 

</blockquote> 

   
<blockquote id="quote2"> 
In life, there are 4 types of people. 

<ul> 

<li> people who think the Internet is good,</li>
<li> people who think the Internet is evil,</li>
<li> people who think the Internet is cats,</li>
<li> people who don't think about it.</li>

</ul>

<p> 
<i> Up in space</i>, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. <br> 
From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.<br> 
Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue. <br> 

<i> Down here</i>, the only reality is the one inside our brain. <br> 
Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message.<br> 
That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. <br>
If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way. <br>
Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake. <br>

<strong> They’re proofs to that.</strong> <br> Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. <br>
   Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. <br> 
   But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. <br>
   Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway. <br> <br>

<p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. <br>
That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. <br>
They said, <q id="person">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> <br>
The farmer said, <q id="farmer">it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q> 
</p>

<p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q id="person"> Oh, isn’t that lucky.
What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> <br>
The farmer again said, <q id="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p> The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. <br>
The neighbors then said, <q id="person">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q id="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. <br>
Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q id="person">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q id="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q>
</p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad
 — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it... <br>
